# Remediation as Code - Self Healing
The sample application is designed to throw errors in Production environment. It passes the quality gate by performing well in Staging but fails only in Production. This causes Dynatrace to create a problem Alert which calls an Azure Function. The Azure Function initializes Self Healing and reverts back a previous good release from Azure Devops
